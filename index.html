	I love code next its a place where you get to express yourself and learn how to code and strengthen your leader-ship skills! The community is very nice, if you have any problems you can talk to the coaches or the students, they'd be glad to help you!
	The lessons that they will teach you are essential for life! Especially if you want a job in the computer science field or even other fields that have nothing to do with coding!
